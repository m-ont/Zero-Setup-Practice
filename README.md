# Zero-Setup-Practice
Minecraft Datapack for Mescht's Zero Practice Map that adds an option to despawn the Ender Dragon to practice zero setups.

Note:
It works for any map but the sign toggle is placed relative to Mescht's map's spawn platform
You can move the sign by changing the values in "Setup Practice\data\setup_practice\functions\tick"
