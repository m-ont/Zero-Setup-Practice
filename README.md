# Zero-Setup-Practice
Minecraft Datapack for Mescht's Zero Practice Map that adds an option to despawn the Ender Dragon to practice zero setups without being hit.

**Note:**
It works for any map but the sign toggle is placed relative to Mescht's map's spawn platform
You can move the sign by changing the values in "Setup Practice\data\setup_practice\functions\tick"

[Download](https://github.com/m-ont/Zero-Setup-Practice/releases/download/v1.0/Setup_Practice.zip) the zip file and extract the content it into in your world's "datapacks" folder (use "**Extract Here**").
